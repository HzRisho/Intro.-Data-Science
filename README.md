# Intro.-Data-Science
Dataset Description:
Walmart's dataset includes historical sales data for 45 stores across various regions. The data features several promotional markdown events throughout the year, primarily preceding major holidays such as the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Weeks including these holidays are particularly critical, being weighted five times higher in evaluations than non-holiday weeks. The challenge lies in modeling the impact of markdowns during these key periods despite the absence of complete historical data.

By employing a robust data analysis approach involving preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, this project aims to enhance the understanding of sales dynamics and improve demand forecasting for Walmart's retail operations.
